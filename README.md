<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cyrus David</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate full-stack developer from the Philippines</h3>

<h4>
I'm in my third year of computer science study. I have web development experience and am a quick learner of programming languages. During my first year of college, I began with C++, fell in love with Python, and had a secret love affair with Ruby and typed languages.  Computer Vision and Tracking Systems have recently piqued my interest.
